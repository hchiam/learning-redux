# Learning Redux

Just one of the things I'm learning. <https://github.com/hchiam/learning>

**_TL;DR_**: Redux is a predictable state container.

* It can let you debug with ["time travel"](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).
* State can only change via **_emitting an action_**, which are specified with pure **_reducers_**.

`yarn add redux` or `npm install --save redux`

(You can generate a [dependency graph](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-dependency-cruiser) with `bash show_dep_graph.sh`.)

## Examples (via CLI or online sandboxes)

<https://redux.js.org/introduction/examples/>

```bash
cd counter-example
npm install
npm start
```
